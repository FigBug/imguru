<h2> References  </h2>

The World Wide Web Consortium is the definitive standard body for 
XML, and their web pages contain huge amounts of information. 

The definitive spec: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml-20040204/">
http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml-20040204/</a>

I also recommend "XML Pocket Reference" by Robert Eckstein and published by 
OReilly...the book that got the whole thing started.

<h2> Contributors, Contacts, and a Brief History </h2>

Thanks very much to everyone who sends suggestions, bugs, ideas, and 
encouragement. It all helps, and makes this project fun. A special thanks
to the contributors on the web pages that keep it lively.

So many people have sent in bugs and ideas, that rather than list here 
we try to give credit due in the "changes.txt" file.

TinyXML was originally written by Lee Thomason. (Often the "I" still
in the documentation.) Lee reviews changes and releases new versions,
with the help of Yves Berquin, Andrew Ellerton, and the tinyXml community.

We appreciate your suggestions, and would love to know if you 
use TinyXML. Hopefully you will enjoy it and find it useful. 
Please post questions, comments, file bugs, or contact us at:
